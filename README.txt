This package contains an implementation of an algorithm for computing rational points on genus 3 hyperelliptic curves in the **MAGMA** computational algebra system.  

To use this package, you must first download the code by **Reitsma and MÃ¼ller**, which computes the rational torsion subgroup of the Jacobians of genus 3 hyperelliptic curves in **MAGMA** (see the link below).  

If you want to compute rational points:  
- For the **odd-degree** case, refer to the file **`chabauty0g3_degree7.m`**.  
- For the **even-degree** case, refer to the file **`chabauty0g3_degree8.m`**.
